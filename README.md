This is a repository for assessing the likelihood of the adoption of the Regular legal act.

The project was made for the Kaggle competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/regulations-outcome/overview

and reached the top score.


In this repository you have 2 .ipynb files:

law_0.9257.ipynb - code with comments corresponding to the best public submission on Kaggle.
law.ipynb - code without much comments corresponding to the last (actually better, according to my tests) submission with my analysis in the background.

Raw data is not included due to the 100 MB limit. They can be downloaded from

Best wishes!
